# PipelineOS

PipelineOS is a production-oriented sales pipeline dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Recharts, Framer Motion, React Hook Form, and Zod.

It is a focused CRM workspace rather than a generic admin template: authenticated users manage companies, contacts, deals, activities, and tags; PostgreSQL Row Level Security isolates every workspace; and PostgreSQL produces chart-ready analytics through authenticated functions and security-invoker views.

## Features

- Complete Supabase-backed create, read, update, and delete workflows
- Optimistic updates and deletes with rollback on request failure
- Email/password sign-up, confirmation callback, sign-in, sign-out, and password recovery
- Owner-isolated RLS across all seven application tables
- Cross-owner relationship validation for every foreign-key workflow
- Server-computed revenue, pipeline, source, conversion, and activity analytics
- Authenticated global search through a PostgreSQL RPC
- Responsive charts, filters, sorting, pagination, dialogs, toasts, and keyboard navigation
- Server Components for initial reads, bounded queries, loading states, empty states, and error recovery
- Authenticated JSON export containing only the current user's rows

## Why Supabase

Supabase provides PostgreSQL relationships, SQL analytics, email authentication, Row Level Security, migration-based infrastructure, and a production API in one service. The browser receives only the publishable key; PostgreSQL remains the authorization boundary.

## Local setup

1. Install Node.js 22.13 or newer.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the Supabase project URL and publishable key.
4. Run `supabase start` and `supabase db reset`, or apply every migration in `supabase/migrations/` in timestamp order.
5. Run `npm run dev`.

The application does not fall back to local JSON or mock CRM records. Supabase configuration and an authenticated session are required.

## Demo data

The hosted assessment project includes two intentionally different synthetic workspaces:

| Account | Email | Password | Workspace profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alex Morgan | `alex@pipelineos.demo` | `PipelineOS-demo-2026!` | Enterprise, multi-channel pipeline: 9 companies and 13 deals |
| Sam Rivera | `sam@pipelineos.demo` | `PipelineOS-demo-2026!` | Mid-market pipeline: 4 companies and 7 deals |

Use both accounts to compare dashboard metrics and verify the security boundary. These credentials are assessment-only. Each account has different companies, contacts, deal stages, sources, revenue history, tags, and activities.

`supabase/seed.sql` is deterministic development/test data for local or disposable environments. The hosted assessment project contains the same isolated synthetic workspaces through versioned migrations. Demo records live in Supabase and are protected by the same RLS policies as every other workspace; no demo dataset is bundled into the frontend.

Remove assessment accounts and seed migrations before adapting this repository for real customer data.

## Quality commands

- `npm run typecheck` — strict TypeScript verification
- `npm run lint` — ESLint and React rules
- `npm test` — Sites-compatible build and repository contract tests
- `npm run build` — native Next.js/Vercel production build
- `npm run check` — complete release gate, including both deployment targets

## Security model

Every persisted entity carries `owner_id`. Each table has explicit authenticated policies for select, insert, update, and delete using `auth.uid()`. Relationship triggers prevent cross-owner foreign-key references. Analytics and search use `SECURITY INVOKER`; execution is revoked from `PUBLIC` and `anon` and granted only to `authenticated`.
