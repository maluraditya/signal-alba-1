# Build Log: PipelineOS

## Goal & scope decision

I chose to build PipelineOS, a focused sales-pipeline CRM for a small revenue team. Sales data naturally fits the assignment because it has several related entities, clear CRUD workflows, useful aggregations, and a meaningful security boundary between user workspaces.

The implemented scope includes companies, contacts, deals, activities, tags, dashboards, global search, authentication, owner-isolated Row Level Security, and server-computed analytics. I deliberately left out Realtime subscriptions and file attachments because authentication, RLS, and SQL analytics provided a stronger demonstration of backend capability within the assessment scope. The final product uses a consistent light interface; dark mode was removed after visual review in favor of one polished theme.

## Stack & tooling

- **Next.js App Router and TypeScript** — Server Components handle authenticated initial reads while Client Components are limited to forms, charts, command-menu interaction, and optimistic updates. Strict TypeScript catches integration errors before deployment.
- **Tailwind CSS and shadcn-style primitives** — used to create a cohesive product interface without introducing a generic administration template.
- **Supabase** — provides PostgreSQL, relationships, migrations, authentication, Row Level Security, REST access, and SQL functions in one production service.
- **Recharts** — renders the pipeline funnel, revenue trend, source mix, pipeline coverage, and activity-velocity charts from backend aggregates.
- **React Hook Form and Zod** — provide reusable form state and validation for CRM mutations.
- **Framer Motion** — adds restrained list and state transitions, with reduced-motion support.
- **Lucide** — supplies a consistent accessible icon system.
- **Vercel** — hosts the native Next.js production deployment.
- **Supabase CLI and GitHub integration** — keep schema, RLS, functions, and seed fixtures reproducible through versioned SQL.
- **OpenAI Codex** — assisted with implementation, repository inspection, UI iteration, test creation, deployment diagnosis, and documentation. Every generated change was reviewed through TypeScript, lint, builds, automated assertions, or live backend checks before release.

## Key decisions & trade-offs

- **Decision: use a normalized PostgreSQL schema** because the product needs enforceable relationships between companies, contacts, deals, activities, and tags. The alternative considered was a flatter deal-centric model, which would have duplicated company and contact data and weakened relationship queries.
- **Decision: place `owner_id` on every application table** because workspace isolation should be explicit and easy to audit. Relying only on ownership inherited through a parent record would have produced more complicated policies and greater risk of accidental cross-user access.
- **Decision: combine RLS policies with ownership-validation triggers** because RLS protects row access while triggers also prevent a user from creating a relationship to another user's foreign key. RLS alone was not sufficient for this relationship-level invariant.
- **Decision: compute analytics in PostgreSQL** because the brief asks the backend to do real work and returning chart-ready aggregates reduces browser payloads. Pulling every deal into React and aggregating it there was considered but rejected.
- **Decision: use authenticated repository services** because one reusable CRUD abstraction keeps authentication checks, pagination, error handling, and table access consistent. Direct Supabase calls scattered throughout page components would have created duplication.
- **Decision: make the application shell persistent in the root layout** because the sidebar and global-search header should not disappear during route transitions. Page-level shells were simpler initially, but they caused visible unmounting whenever a loading boundary appeared.
- **Decision: support the current Supabase publishable key and the legacy anonymous-key variable** because hosted projects may use either credential format. The service-role key is never shipped to the browser.
- **Decision: keep a single light visual system** because visual testing showed that mixing dark feature panels with light cards made the product feel inconsistent. A dual-theme system was deferred rather than shipping two less-refined themes.
- **Decision: maintain native Next.js and Sites-compatible build targets** because Vercel expects `.next`, while the existing repository workflow also included a Vinext/Cloudflare-compatible target. The native Next.js build is the production default.

## Hard parts / dead ends

- **Supabase GitHub integration initially showed no tables.** The integration needed `02-dashboard` as its working directory because that folder contains `supabase/`. Migrations deploy through the integration, but `supabase/seed.sql` is not automatically executed on the hosted project, so assessment demo workspaces were also represented through versioned migrations.
- **The first Vercel build used a missing generated Vite plugin.** `vite.config.ts` imported from an ignored `build/` directory. The plugin was moved into a committed `config/` directory and covered by a regression test.
- **Vercel then expected `.next`, but the default build produced a Vinext bundle.** The production build command was changed to native `next build`, with the alternate bundle retained as `build:sites`.
- **Authenticated pages failed during prerender with “Supabase is not configured.”** Configuration validation ran before Next.js observed request-bound APIs. Supabase configuration was centralized, authenticated routes were made explicitly dynamic, and the server client now reads request cookies before validating configuration.
- **Google-hosted fonts introduced a build-time network dependency.** A restricted production simulation failed while downloading three fonts. The UI was moved to high-quality system font stacks so builds are self-contained.
- **The original authentication form sent password resets from the sign-in screen.** This gave users little feedback. Recovery was changed into an email-only screen followed by a dedicated inbox confirmation state and the existing new-password page.
- **Chart hover content had unreadable text.** Recharts tooltip styling was inconsistent across charts. A shared black-background, white-text tooltip theme fixed contrast and removed per-chart drift.
- **Dashboard and Analytics initially overlapped too much.** The dashboard was redesigned as an operational command center with a conversion funnel, channel mix, execution velocity, priority queue, and next commitments. Analytics remains the deeper server-aggregated reporting surface.

## How I verified it works

- Ran strict TypeScript checking and ESLint after each production change.
- Ran both the native Next.js/Vercel build and the Vinext/Sites-compatible build.
- Added repository contract tests covering required routes, deployment configuration, persistent layout behavior, the authentication lifecycle, RLS coverage, backend analytics, global search security, and the absence of frontend demo-data fallbacks.
- Verified hosted authentication using two demo accounts with intentionally different workspaces.
- Confirmed Alex can read 9 companies, 9 contacts, 13 deals, 13 activities, and 3 tags.
- Confirmed Sam can read 4 companies, 3 contacts, 7 deals, 8 activities, and 2 tags.
- Queried each account for the other account's company rows and received zero results in both directions.
- Confirmed `get_dashboard_analytics()` returns authenticated, account-specific aggregates for both users.
- Performed reversible create, update, and delete checks against hosted Supabase for companies, contacts, deals, activities, tags, and `deal_tags`; all temporary verification rows were removed.
- Verified anonymous access is rejected and cross-owner relationship writes are blocked by database rules.
- Monitored GitHub-triggered Vercel deployments through completion and confirmed the native production build succeeds even when environment variables are absent during build-time analysis.
- Manually reviewed responsive layouts, empty states, loading skeletons, persistent sidebar navigation, chart tooltips, sign-up confirmation, login/logout, and password-recovery states.

With more time, I would add Playwright coverage for complete browser-based authentication and CRUD flows, run those tests in CI against a disposable Supabase branch, and add automated accessibility checks.

## Known limitations

- Supabase Realtime subscriptions are not implemented; users see committed data after a mutation or navigation rather than cross-tab live updates.
- File attachments and Supabase Storage are not included because the selected CRM workflows do not require them for the assessment.
- Server reads are deliberately bounded and the UI provides pagination, but very large workspaces would benefit from cursor-based pagination and URL-persisted filters.
- The product currently ships one polished light theme rather than light and dark modes.
- The project does not yet include production error monitoring, alerting, point-in-time recovery configuration, or application-level rate-limit dashboards.
- Authentication email delivery still depends on the Supabase email provider and its production SMTP configuration.
- Lighthouse scores must be recorded against the final public production URL and added to the submission evidence.
- Demo accounts and synthetic seed rows are assessment fixtures and must be removed before onboarding real customers.

## Time spent

The initial assessment-ready build took approximately **4 hours**. Additional review-driven polish and production hardening took approximately **3 hours**, for roughly **7 hours total**.

- Product scope, schema, and architecture: ~45 minutes
- Supabase migrations, authentication, RLS, and seed workspaces: ~80 minutes
- CRUD services, forms, search, and route implementation: ~85 minutes
- SQL analytics, charts, and dashboard composition: ~75 minutes
- Documentation and security verification: ~45 minutes
- UI iteration, authentication UX, deployment diagnosis, and production hardening: ~90 minutes

The extra time beyond the original assessment window went primarily into deployment compatibility, live security verification, and interface iteration rather than expanding the product scope.
